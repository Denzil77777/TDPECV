 # üöÄ‚ú® Terraform - AWS Cloud Front - Curriculum Vitae


This small  IaC; Terraform project shows you how to publish your Curriculum Vitae using **Terraform (IaC)** and **AWS CloudFront**.  
It also demonstrates the steps how to manage your Curriculum Vitae, after converting into HTML  from MS-Office, Google Docs, PDF and deliver it through AWS Services. The aim is to showcase the power of Terraform (Ia, in combination with other Software and applications. 
The Power of Terraform means, how to create and destroy Infrastructure, using, (in this example ) AWS Cloud Services.



## üöÄ Features
- Deploys AWS CloudFront distribution via Terraform.
- Demonstrates the power of Infrastructure as Code (iMac); Terraform best practices.
- Stores and serves CV in HTML format, letting HR Managers access your Curriculum Vitae via the CloudFront URL.
- AWS Cloud Front - Curriculum Vitae, is easily customizable for personal or professional use.
- Use Microsoft Vocoder where you have the freedom to alter my details with yours, in the .html which I have I have shared with.
- The steps are for Microsoft Windows 10 Professional; Microsoft VSCode was installed for, Windows 10 Professional.
- I might do same for Linux later


## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used - For this Project
- **AWS Services** (CloudFront, S3, IAM).  
- **Terraform** (for Infrastructure as Code).
- **Microsoft VSCode** (Editor for Infrastructure as Code, HTTP, CSS, etc).  
- **MS Office 365 / Google Docs** (in the event your CV is with MS Office and or Google Docs).  
- **PDF**  

 ## Your  Curriculum Vitae

If you have your document (CV) in a .PDF you can use Adobe to convert to HTML using "Export PDF Tool. You can have a free trial with Adobe. However, the downside is you have to use your credit card, in a view to obtain that free 7 days.

In order to help you, I searched for options and found; https://app.gonitro.com/ They offer you a 14-day trial.

## The Method I used.

The method I adopted was, since I have my Curriculum Vitae, in Microsoft Word, and if you too have your CV in .docx, you can use MS-Word to open your document and Save AS, option MyCV.HTML. (You may assign a name as you wish).
Using the converted file, (HTML file) I have used Microsoft VS Code to create a HTML, CSS to make it more professional and presentable. I used this approach, since two of my modules (1) Internet and the Multimedia and (2) Programming the Internet for my MSc in 2013, which came handy. The attached image of my CV is self-explanatory. Or if you like the HTML, I have shared you with, you are free to armed accordingly. I mean your professional experiences, as a Show Case for a HR Manager.
A word of warning! In MS-Word, though it gives the facility you have a Document in HTML, MS-Word will generate normal HTML file. No styles, no colours and so on. Not like the one I have produced.



## Methods / Notes for; How to install terraform in Microsoft Windows 10 Professional.

In my case I had created Folder; C:\TeraForm_09MAY2025. In a view to download Terraform in a separate Folder, and Initially I executed Terraform, from this command prompt. C:\TeraForm_09MAY2025. Which is my Terraform Folder.

- Link for Terraform;https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install#windows

## How to Configure AWS CLI in Windows, so that Terraform shall make that API to AWS Cloud

There are two parts (1) I am hoping you have an AWS Account, and (2) If you do not have an account.

## Methods / Notes: For those who does not have an AWS Account.

## How to install VScode

+ I have found myself to be very comfortable with Microsoft VSCode. At the same time, I am confident, that each one of you have your own editors. Having said that, I suggest, you may please use Microsoft VSCode for this Project! 

+ Go to (or in a Google Search, type vscode) https://code.visualstudio.com/download. Someting similar to below image.

[<img src="Documents/Visual_Studio_Code.png" alt="Terraform" width="300">](Documents/Visual_Studio_Code.png)

## How to configure VScode for terraform

 - Microsoft VSCode was used as my HTML editor (most do),for creating and destroying IaS, in this  case,  for the infrastructure for AWS Cloud.
- I have shared the corresponding HTML file which corresponds to my CV,  (Valuable link) which is a part of Terraform, the API for AWS  CloudFront.
- It can be, within a CV one does not present their certificates. I made an extra effort,  in a view to show case. You may disregard that part.
- The HTML  was first tested on my local computer. C:/test_Drive; denzilCV.html
- After a successful test, I added the corresponding images into the same folder. If you may read the HTML file I have referred to the images within the HTML. This was a local test. 
- If you are using images similar to mine, kindly note that,  upon executing Terraform  (i) init, (ii) Terraform fmt, (iii) Terraform Plan, and finally (iv) Terraform -auto-apply.
- In a layman's way, login to your AWS Console, based on the AWS region you have used, or you are at; in my case eu-central-1. 
- From the AWS Console, you may search CloudFront,  Distributions, and you should see something similar like the screenshots I have attached. 
- For the moment, for this  mini project, you need to  first go to S3, and upload the corresponding images, into S3 creted by Terraform. Please see my belo screenshot for your easy reference. It is found uder Documemts/CloudFront_Distribute_i.png, too

[<img src="Documents/CloudFront_Distribute_i.png" alt="Terraform" width="400">](Documents/CloudFront_Distribute_i.png)

- Now  being at AWS Cloudfront,  Distributions,  Copy the  link, ( Distribution Domain name) and you should see your wonderful CV!
- Here is the way CV is displayed!

<p align="center">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td align="center">
        <a href="Documents/">
